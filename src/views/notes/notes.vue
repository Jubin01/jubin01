    <h4>pff. okay. i'm trying to port this site in part or full for 'smart' feature phones. also will try to develop a
      different version
      for dumb feature phones like a wap site or an app/s. not really sure how to go about that.

    <h4>okay i know everythings center aligned, and it doesn't look right. but anyways blogger page is up (using the
      bloggerapi btw). though won't do
      the same with youtubeapi (if it exists). i'd rather just link youtube videos to blogger. i'd leave my youtube
      channel link somewhere in this site. maybe i'll use the youtubeapi sometime later. maybe.</h4>

    <h4>how bout importing from youtube? i think that's what i'm gonna try next. though i'm not sure about the comment
      section making it here. same goes for blogger comments. if it is simple to implement then i'll try. definitely
      don't think the ability to add comments will come here, cauz that might be a bit difficult to implement?
      hmmm. come to think of it. i can import youtube to blogger, and then import that here as well. so some way or the
      other...
      i'm happy if i can just show the content here, comments may or may not make it :p .

    <h4>how bout trying out some (more) unit tests before. just some basic ones, just to get my foot wet (again). it
      could help later. hopefully, we can write more useful tests as we go on ðŸ¤ž.</h4>
