        Working on a feature phone version? 
        update22nov2021: 
        I was looking into the market share for feature phones in India and Africa, and there's still a considerable chunk.
        But, I started this as a hobby, and I'm not sure if I want to learn a new language to be able to do this.
         Hopefully feature phones can have better browsers in future?
         I would have made an effort, but suddenly I saw the ill effects of all these mobile towers on the ecology (not humans), 
         and that seemed to have been another downer for me. So, not so sure. 
         Maybe more studies are needed in this aspect, I don't know. But yeah, that's it for now.
